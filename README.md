Automotive Industry , Data Science, Machine Learning

This aim to enhance the customer experience and streamline the pricing process by leveraging machine learning.To create an accurate and user-friendly streamlit tool that predicts the prices of used cars based on various features. This tool should be deployed as an interactive web application for both customers and sales representatives to use seamlessly.
with the historical data on used car prices from CarDekho, including various features such as make, model, year, fuel type, transmission type, and other relevant attributes from different cities. To develop a machine learning model that can accurately predict the prices of used cars based on these features. The model integrated into a Streamlit-based web application to allow users to input car details and receive an estimated price instantly.

# Approach:
 1. Data Processing:Import and concatenate->Handling Missing Values->Standardising Data Formats->Encoding Categorical Variables->Normalizing Numerical Features->Removing Outliers
 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):Descriptive Statistics->Data Visualization->Feature Selection
 3. Model Development:Train-Test Split->Model Selection->Model Training->Hyperparameter Tuning
 4. Model Evaluation:Performance Metrics->Model Comparison
 5. Optimization:Feature Engineering->Regularization
 6. Deployment:Streamlit Application

# Results: 
A functional and accurate machine learning model for predicting used car prices.
Comprehensive analysis and visualizations of the dataset.
Detailed documentation explaining the methodology, models, and results.
An interactive Streamlit application for real-time price predictions based on user input.
